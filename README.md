# Eventlify

Eventlify is a Next.js 14 project, created by Nevil, with a focus on event management and ticket purchasing. Built using Next.js and MongoDB, and hosted on OnRender, this platform allows users to discover events nearby, purchase tickets, and even create their own events with custom details. It utilizes Clerk for authentication, Stripe for payment processing (including webhooks for payment confirmations), and UploadThing for image uploading. Additionally, Zod and React Hook Form are used for robust form validation, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
